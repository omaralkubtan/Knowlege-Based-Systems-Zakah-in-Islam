# Zakah in Islam: A Knowledge-Based System

This is a project that implements a knowledge-based system for calculating and determining zakah in Islam. Zakah is one of the five pillars of Islam and a religious obligation for Muslims who have a certain amount of wealth. It involves giving a fixed percentage of one's wealth to specific categories of people who are in need. This project aims to help Muslims perform this duty correctly and easily by using an expert system that can infer the rules and criteria of zakah from the Quran and Sunnah.

## Features

This project has the following features:

- It can calculate the amount of zakah for different types of wealth, such as money, gold, silver, livestock, and crops.
- It can determine if a person is eligible to pay or receive zakah based on their income, expenses, debts, and assets.
- It can handle different scenarios and cases of zakah, such as nisab (the minimum threshold of wealth), hawl (the lunar year), and nisab al-fitr (the obligatory charity at the end of Ramadan).
- It can provide explanations and references for each rule and calculation.
- It has a graphical user interface that allows the user to enter their information and view the results.

## Technologies

This project is built with Python using the experta library. Experta is a framework for building knowledge-based systems that uses the Rete algorithm for efficient inference. It allows defining facts, rules, and engines that can reason over the facts and fire the rules.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and experta installed on your system. You can install experta using pip:

```bash
pip install experta
```

Then you can clone this repository or download it as a zip file. To run the project, navigate to the project folder and execute:

```bash
python start.py
```

## Usage

When you run the project, you will see a window with two tabs: Calculate Zakah and Deserve Zakah.

- In the Calculate Zakah tab, you can enter your name and the values for each type of wealth that you have. You can enter any numeric value or 0 if not applicable. Then click on the Calculate button to see the result. The result will show you the total amount of zakah that you have to pay, as well as the breakdown for each type of wealth. It will also show you the explanations and references for each rule and calculation.
- In the Deserve Zakah tab, you can enter your name and the values for your income, expenses, debts, and assets. You can enter any numeric value or 0 if not applicable. Then click on the Check button to see the result. The result will tell you if you are eligible to receive zakah or not, based on your financial situation. It will also show you the explanations and references for each rule and determination.
